## Main considerations

In the optical propagation simulation we describe evolution of electromagnetic field from a state defined at some time and space region to another state that it takes after some time and in a different space region.

This problem can be described by the Maxwell equations:

```math
\begin{aligned}
 & \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = - \partial_t \mathbf{B}\,,\\
 & \nabla \times \mathbf{H} = \partial_t \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{J}\,,\\
 & \nabla \mathbf{D} = \rho\,,\\
 & \nabla  \mathbf{B} =0\,,
\end{aligned}
```

accompanied by the *constitutive* equations

```math
\begin{aligned}
 & \mathbf{D}  = \epsilon_0 \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P} \,,\\
 & \mathbf{H}  = \cfrac{1}{\mu_0} \mathbf{B} - \mathbf{M} \,.
\end{aligned}
```

In following we will assume that all charges of the system are be free, i.e. $\epsilon_0$ and $\mu_0$ are the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of vacuum. Moreover, at the current stage of development we will only consider **plasma** processes and discard the polarization and magentization of the media $\mathbf{P}=0$ and $\mathbf{M}=0$.

To describe the optical field in most partical situations it is enough to follow the electric field, and equation for it can be derived as:

```math
\begin{aligned}
 & \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} - \frac{1}{c^2} \; \partial_t^2 \mathbf{E} = \mu_0\; \partial_t\mathbf{J}  + \frac{1}{\epsilon_0}\nabla \rho\,.
\end{aligned}
```

Here the left hand side is the wave equation which describes propagation of the initial field in vacuum (the _optical beam_ whose dynamics we study). The terms in the right hand side are the currents and density modulations, which act as the _sources_ for the field generated by the media as a response to the optical field.

The two source terms are essenatially different. The first one is excited _instantaneously_ as electrons move in the field and generate electric currents. The second term constitutes charge density modulations and it is typically slower and much weaker one. Let us demonstrate this by assuming the charge continuity (ionized plasma for simplicity) and re-writing the source terms as:

```math
\begin{aligned}
 & \mu_0 \; \partial_t\mathbf{J}  + \frac{1}{\epsilon_0}\nabla \rho =  \frac{1}{\epsilon_0 } \int_{-\infty}^{t} dt' \left(\frac{1}{c^2} \; \partial_t^2 \mathbf{J} -   \nabla (\nabla \mathbf{J}) \right)\,,
\end{aligned}
```

and comparing the terms under the intergral. In the Fourier space, these terms appear as $k^2 \hat{\mathbf{J}}$ and $\mathbf{k}\cdot (\mathbf{k} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{J}})$, where $k=\omega/c$, and for the polarized field, it is enough to consider a single transverse component (e.g. $\mathbf{J} \parallel \mathbf{E} \parallel \mathbf{e}_x$) and discard others. The ratio between source terms therefore reads, $k^2/k_x^2$, and for the field wavelength $\lambda_0$, and transverse size $R$, it scales as $\propto (R/\lambda_0)^2$. It is easy to see, that in most practical situations this indeed allows to assume $\mu_0 \; \partial_t\mathbf{J} \gg \frac{1}{\epsilon_0}\nabla \rho$, and discard contribution of the charge density modulations compared to the induced currents.

To conclude this part, in the calculations we will consider the equation for the electric field in the following form:

```math
\begin{aligned}
 & \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} - \frac{1}{c^2} \partial_t^2 \mathbf{E} = \mu_0  \partial_t\mathbf{J}  \,,
\end{aligned}
```

and moreover we will use it as a scalar equation, for the field and current components along the laser field polarisation.

## Particular cases

#### Vacuum case

In a case when no sources are present in the system, i.e. field propagates in vacuum, the equation simplifies down to the uniform wave eqaution

```math
\begin{aligned}
& \nabla^2 E = \frac{1}{c^2} \; \partial_t^2 E
\end{aligned}
```

#### Plasma dispersion

A simplest linear plasma response can be described with the help of non-relativistic motion equation:

```math
\begin{aligned}
& \mu_0 \partial_t J = -e \; \mu_0 \;n_{pe} \; \partial_t v = \omega_{pe}^2 / c^2 E
\end{aligned}
```

where $n_{pe}$ is a number density of plasma electrons, and $\omega_{pe} = \sqrt{\frac{e^2 n_{pe} }{\epsilon_0  m_e}}$ is a plasma frequency. Introducing this term in the optical equation leads to

```math
\nabla^2 E = \cfrac{1}{c^2} \; (\partial_t^2 \;+ \;\omega_{pe}^2)  E
```

And considering it in the spatio-temporal Fourier domain provides us the basic dispersion relation

```math
\omega^2 = k^2 c^2 + \omega_{pe}^2
```
